// This defines the built-in types and their core representations in memory.
// Since Wren is dynamically typed, any variable can hold a value of any type,
// and the type can change at runtime. Implementing this efficiently is
// critical for performance.
//
// The main type exposed by this is [Value]. A C variable of that type is a
// storage location that can hold any Wren value. The stack, module variables,
// and instance fields are all implemented in C as variables of type Value.
//
// The built-in types for booleans, numbers, and null are unboxed: their value
// is stored directly in the Value, and copying a Value copies the value. Other
// types--classes, instances of classes, functions, lists, and strings--are all
// reference types. They are stored on the heap and the Value just stores a
// pointer to it. Copying the Value copies a reference to the same object. The
// Wren implementation calls these "Obj", or objects, though to a user, all
// values are objects.
//
// There is also a special singleton value "undefined". It is used internally
// but never appears as a real value to a user. It has two uses:
//
// - It is used to identify module variables that have been implicitly declared
//   by use in a forward reference but not yet explicitly declared. These only
//   exist during compilation and do not appear at runtime.
//
// - It is used to represent unused map entries in an ObjMap.
//
// There are two supported Value representations. The main one uses a technique
// called "NaN tagging" (explained in detail below) to store a number, any of
// the value types, or a pointer, all inside one double-precision floating
// point number. A larger, slower, Value type that uses a struct to store these
// is also supported, and is useful for debugging the VM.
//
// The representation is controlled by the `WREN_NAN_TAGGING` define. If that's
// defined, Nan tagging is used.

// These macros cast a Value to one of the specific object types. These do *not*
// perform any validation, so must only be used after the Value has been
// ensured to be the right type.

// | |          |
// S[Exponent-][Mantissa------------------------------------------]
//
// The details of how these are used to represent numbers aren't really
// relevant here as long we don't interfere with them. The important bit is NaN.
//
// An IEEE double can represent a few magical values like NaN ("not a number"),
// Infinity, and -Infinity. A NaN is any value where all exponent bits are set:
//
//  v--NaN bits
// -11111111111----------------------------------------------------
//
// Here, "-" means "doesn't matter". Any bit sequence that matches the above is
// a NaN. With all of those "-", it obvious there are a *lot* of different
// bit patterns that all mean the same thing. NaN tagging takes advantage of
// this. We'll use those available bit patterns to represent things other than
// numbers without giving up any valid numeric values.
//
// NaN values come in two flavors: "signalling" and "quiet". The former are
// intended to halt execution, while the latter just flow through arithmetic
// operations silently. We want the latter. Quiet NaNs are indicated by setting
// the highest mantissa bit:
//
//             v--Highest mantissa bit
// -[NaN      ]1---------------------------------------------------
//
// If all of the NaN bits are set, it's not a number. Otherwise, it is.
// That leaves all of the remaining bits as available for us to play with. We
// stuff a few different kinds of things here: special singleton values like
// "true", "false", and "null", and pointers to objects allocated on the heap.
// We'll use the sign bit to distinguish singleton values from pointers. If
// it's set, it's a pointer.
//
// v--Pointer or singleton?
// S[NaN      ]1---------------------------------------------------
//
// For singleton values, we just enumerate the different values. We'll use the
// low bits of the mantissa for that, and only need a few:
//
//                                                 3 Type bits--v
// 0[NaN      ]1------------------------------------------------[T]
//
// For pointers, we are left with 51 bits of mantissa to store an address.
// That's more than enough room for a 32-bit address. Even 64-bit machines
// only actually use 48 bits for addresses, so we've got plenty. We just stuff
// the address right into the mantissa.
//
// Ta-da, double precision numbers, pointers, and a bunch of singleton values,
// all stuffed into a single 64-bit sequence. Even better, we don't have to
